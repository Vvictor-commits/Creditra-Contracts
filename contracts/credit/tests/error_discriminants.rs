//! Stable-discriminant assertion tests for `ContractError`.
//!
//! These tests are the **CI guard** against accidental reordering or renumbering
//! of error variants. If any assertion fails, it means a discriminant was changed
//! in a way that would break deployed SDK clients.
//!
//! # Rules
//! - Never change an existing assertion value.
//! - New variants must be appended at the end of the enum with the next integer.
//! - Add a corresponding assertion here when adding a new variant.
