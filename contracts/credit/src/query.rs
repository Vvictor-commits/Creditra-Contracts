/// # Stability
/// The returned [`CreditLineData`] struct is stable for integrators.
/// All fields — including `last_rate_update_ts`, `accrued_interest`, and
/// `last_accrual_ts` — are serialized in the order declared in `types.rs`.
/// New fields will only be appended; existing field positions will not change.
///
/// # Note on accrual
/// Interest accrual is lazy: `accrued_interest` and `utilized_amount` reflect
/// the last mutating call (draw, repay, suspend, etc.). Pending interest since
/// the last checkpoint is **not** applied by this query.
